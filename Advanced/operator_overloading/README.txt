General description:
	This solution is a console-based C++ application developed in Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit)
  Current Version 17.9.7. The application is designed to manage the Mat3x3 ADT, 2 dimensional arrays representing
  matrices with 3 rows and 3 columns. 

	Mat3x3 are objects represented by std::array<std::array<double, 3>, 3>.

	The solution consists of 3 files: "Mat3x3.h", "Mat3x3.cpp", and "main.cpp".

	The header file contains all declarations for member and non-member functions, the definitions for instance and
  global variables, as well as descriptive comments about each function. Mat3x3.cpp contains the definitions for 
  all methods and functions. 

	The solution is designed with a focus on object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation. 
  It demonstrates the extensive use of operator overloading and exception handling in C++.

Instructions:
	This program was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Current Version 17.9.7. 
  It was compiled using c++20. There are no special instructions for running it. The program can be compiled
  and run in an C++ set up environment, as well as in any IDE.

Extra features:
	I included additional assert statements on the main file so that all operators were tested.

There are no known bugs in the program.

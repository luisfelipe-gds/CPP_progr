General description:
	This solution is a console-based C++ application developed in Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit)
  Current Version 17.9.7. 

  The application is designed to manage categories of words. 	Each category is represented  by a WordCat object, 
  and all categories are stored in a WordCatVec object. WordCatVec class is a container class that holds a 
  std::vector<WordCat> of WordCat objects.

	Each WordCat object represents a category of words and includes methods for managing the words in the category. 
  The words in a category are stored in a WordList object. 

	The WordList class uses a std::list<word> to store Word objects. It includes methods for adding, removing, and 
  searching for Word objects in the list.

	The Word class represents a word, a std::<string> object, and includes methods for manipulating the word.
	
	The VocabDriver.cpp file includes test functions for the Word, WordList, WordCat, and WordCatVec classes. 

	The solution is designed with a focus on object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation, 
  inheritance, and polymorphism. It demonstrates the use exception handling, file I/O, and operator overloading 
  in C++.

Instructions:
	This program was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Current Version 17.9.7. 
  There are no special instructions for running it. The program can be compiled and run in an C++ set up environment, 
  as well as in any IDE.

Extra features:
	I implemented a method that dinamically sets the width of the column equal to the width of the largest word 
  in the category or vector. it is WordList::setMaxLength().

There are no known bugs in the program.

General description:
	This solution is a console-based C++ application developed in Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit)
  Current Version 17.9.7. The application is designed to practice several c++ functionalities as covered in lectures. 

	The header file supplied by the professor ("assignment5.h") contains several function declarations, whose 
  implementations were developed in "assignment5.cpp". These implementations provide practice to several c++ concepts
  such as lambda expressions, functors, and free functions. Also, they require working with iterators and algorithms 
  from the STL library. Lastly, they offer an example of a class that works as an iterator.

	The assignment submission consists of 6 files: 
		- modified/implemented: "assignment5.cpp", "FibGen.h", "A5_output.txt"
		- unchanged: "assignment5.h", "assignment_5_test_driver.cpp", "words.txt"

	The solution is designed with a focus on object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation. 

Instructions:
	This program was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Current Version 17.9.7. It was 
  compiled using c++20. There are no special instructions for running it. The program can be compiled and run in an 
  C++ set up environment, as well as in any IDE.

There are no known bugs in the program.
